Morse Code Binary Tree. 

# Project Description
This project uses a text file to create a Binary Tree using morse code. The input file is structured with the character at the front with the corresponding morse code immediately following (e.g. a.- | b-... | c-.-. | d-..)

User can input a string to encode and decode a message that the user enters (e.g. "abc" encodes to .- -.. -.-. and -.-. -.. decodes to cb).     
   
   
   
Project assumes that the character delimiters are simply spaces and that the user input string has only lowercase letters with no spaces.
